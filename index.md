[NFL Expected Points Analysis](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jacoblundeen/NFL_Expected_Points_Analysis/blob/main/Course_Project_HTML.html)
<br><br>
Expected Points is an equivalence metric for American Football that has been around since the 1960's and was reborn in the 2000's. In this project, 
I utilize the nflfastR data set, along with the ggplot2 and tidyverse packages to perform a regression analysis on the the data to determine what 
statistics most highly correlate to Expected Points Added and look at any predictive value of the models.

[EPA as a Predictor](/pdfs/Lundeen_Final_Paper.pdf)
<br><br>
In the National Football League, the Quarterback is the single most important position. Not just in its own sport, but no other modern team sport is as heavily dependent on a single position like American Football is on the Quarterback. In this project, I continue my analysis of Expected Points by comparing it to other modern metrics and utilize multivariate regression to determine their predictive power. As well, I created an RShiny app to show the correlations between the metrics.

[Exercise Prediction](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jacoblundeen/Coursera_Machine_Learning_Project/blob/master/Machine_Learning.html)
<br><br>
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. In this project, I will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of six participants that were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. Using this data, I attempt to correctly predict which exercise the participants were doing and if they did them correctly or not.
